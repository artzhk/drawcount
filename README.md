# [drawcount](https://artzhk.github.io/drawcount/)
Simple web app to draw strokes and get the number of drawn ones. Created by request of my friends from universities labs.

# Why? 
Couldn't find something similar on internet. That is why it is here.

# ToDo:
- Save photos path and count number to database, per user. Get list of uploaded photos and strokes counted for every pic was in use.
